# Text-Analysis
This program provides basic text analysis tools. It allows users to input any text and perform various operations, such as counting words, finding the longest word, counting specific substrings, and extracting unique words. The program runs in a loop, enabling multiple operations on the same text until the user decides to exit.
Features:

Word Count: Splits the text into individual words and counts the total number of words.
Find Longest Word: Identifies the longest word in the given text.
Count of Substring: Allows the user to input a substring and counts how many times it occurs in the text.
Unique Words: Extracts and lists all unique words from the text, ignoring duplicates.
Exit: Allows the user to exit the program after completing desired operations.
How to Run:

Run the Python script in a terminal or command line.
Enter the text when prompted.
Select an analysis option by entering a number (1-5).
The result of the selected analysis will be displayed.
Repeat or exit as needed.
